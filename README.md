# wasm-react-todo

A simple Rust-WASM project to add and remove a TODO items.

1. Built the simple UI using react boiler plate code: 
  i. TODO Input, TODO Submit Button,  TODO Listing
  ii. TODO Listing with --Remove-- actions
2. Simple Rust code :
  i. TODO struct and CRUD operations using 'wasm-bindgen' and 'seder'

 converted Rust code to WASM using wasm-pack and got the pkg. 
 The pkg was then published to npm.

 The published package was then consumed in the react app for todo CRUD actions.
